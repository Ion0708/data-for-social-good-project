What I asked
-Can you give me a method that will look through my 1d Arays and use a system to figure out who is the greatest player using the stats in my arrays?
What response I recieved - 
Absolutely — here is a clean, flexible, scalable “Greatest Player” method that scans ALL your 1D arrays and computes a GOAT score using a weighted formula.

This method:

✔ Looks at PPG, FG%, and Turnovers
✔ Applies a weighted scoring system
✔ Rounds to the nearest tenth
✔ Returns player name, team, year, and score
✔ Works with your variables:
players[], playerTeams[], playerYear[],
playerPpg[], playerFgpct[], playerAvgTurnover[]

⭐ GOAT Scoring System

You can adjust the weights, but here is a balanced default:

PPG → weight 2.0 (scoring matters most)

FG% → weight 1.5 (efficiency matters)

Turnovers → weight -1.0 (lower is better)

Formula: score = (PPG * 2.0) + (FG% * 1.5) - (Turnovers * 1.0)

What I asked
-Can you give me a code segment that can round a double into a number with just one decimal? - 
What response I recieved - 
Yes — super easy!
Just use Math.round(score * 10) / 10.0 to round to the nearest tenth.
